# Creating and Assigning Permission Sets

Permissions are granted by
* creating permission sets
* assigning these permissions sets to
  * users as global fallback permissions
  * user groups as local permissions
* assigning these user groups to
  * facets as local default permissions
  * hierarchical element nodes as inheritable local explicit permissions

To manage those points go to the Admin area in Symbio and select the appropriate section:
